This skill guides the creation of high-converting marketing and product copy. Read `requirements.md` and the existing codebase to understand the product, audience, and page structure before writing anything. Derive tone, terminology, and content focus from the actual context.

## Approach

1. **Read the requirements** — understand the product, audience, and goals
2. **Study existing copy** — match tone and style if there's already content in the codebase
3. **Write for the audience** — technical audiences need credibility, not hype. Consumer audiences need emotion, not specs. Adapt.
4. **Serve the page structure** — copy must fit the UI. A hero headline is not a paragraph. A CTA is not a sentence.

## Language Guidelines

### Vietnamese
- Write natural Vietnamese — avoid awkward literal translations from English
- Vietnamese diacritics must always be correct
- Technical terms can stay in English where that's standard practice (AI, DevOps, CI/CD, API)
- Mix Vietnamese and English naturally as Vietnamese tech professionals do

### English
- Clean, direct writing
- Avoid marketing buzzwords that erode trust ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "disruptive")
- Prefer specifics over generalities

## Copy Principles

### Headlines & Titles
- Short — under 10 words for primary headlines
- Benefit-first — lead with what the reader gains
- Pain-point aware — address real frustrations
- Bad: "A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Technology"
- Good: "Ship Better Software with AI — Starting Today"

### CTAs (Call-to-Action)
- Action verbs, not descriptions
- Vary across sections — don't repeat the same CTA everywhere
- Primary: Bold and direct ("Mua Ngay", "Get Started")
- Secondary: Softer, lower commitment ("Xem Thử", "Learn More")
- Create gentle urgency without pressure tactics

### Value Propositions
- One clear benefit per item + 2-3 sentence explanation
- Concrete numbers and outcomes over vague promises
- Always answer "so what?" — why should the reader care?

### FAQ Content
- Write questions in the reader's skeptical voice
- Answers: honest, direct, concise
- Don't oversell — acknowledge limitations where appropriate
- Include objection-handling questions

### Testimonials
- Sound like real people, not marketing
- Include specific details about what was valuable
- Vary perspectives across roles and experience levels

### Trust Signals
- Present credentials and social proof factually, not boastfully
- Guarantees and policies in clear, plain language

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

- Generic filler that says nothing ("This amazing product will change your life")
- Excessive exclamation marks or ALL CAPS
- Pressure tactics that insult the reader's intelligence
- Claims without backing ("The #1 solution" — says who?)
- Wall-of-text paragraphs — keep everything scannable
- Inconsistent tone between sections
